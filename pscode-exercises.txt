// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
print on the screen odd and even number

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

five separate numbers are,
num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5
the average of five numbers is sum of all five divided by 5
(num1+num2+num3+num4+num5)/5
print average
smallest=num1
largest=num5
print smallest and largest number
print on the screen average of 5 number
print on the screen smallest and largest number
